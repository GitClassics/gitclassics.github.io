{"name":"GitClassics","tagline":"Collaborate to Edit, Translate, and Publish New Latin Texts","body":"# _Salve_! Welcome to GitClassics!\r\n### GitClassics is a collaborative effort to edit, translate, and publish new Latin texts using GitHub.\r\n### Even if you have no knowledge of Latin, you can help bring these forgotten artifacts back to life with a pull request.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## What's this all about?\r\n\r\nOn account of projects like Google Books and the Internet Archive, there are literally tens of thousands of new Latin texts available on the Internet. Many well-known texts from antiquity are available at [The Perseus Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu), and even some medieval and early modern texts are also available at [The Latin Library](http://www.thelatinlibrary.com), but there is still an enormous amount of Latin literature that is available only as scanned images, not as plaintext. To get an idea of the amount of books out there, take a look at the [collection of Latin language texts available at HathiTrust](http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Search/Home?adv=1&type[]=all&lookfor[]=&bool[]=AND&type[]=author&lookfor[]=&bool[]=AND&type[]=title&lookfor[]=&bool[]=AND&type[]=subject&lookfor[]=&setft=true&ft=ft&yop=after&fqrange-start-publishDateTrie-1=&fqrange-end-publishDateTrie-1=&fqor-publishDateTrie[]=&fqor-language[]=Latin&submit=Search).\r\n\r\nGitClassics aims to make some of these obscure Latin texts more readily available by editing, translating, and publishing them on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Can't OCR do this for us?\r\nProbably not as well as a bunch of human readers. And part of the fun is becoming more familiar with the vast literature of the Latin language by working closely with these texts.\r\n\r\nGitClassics also aims to build a community of translators, not just readers, who can work together to write modern-language editions of these old texts. OCR can't translate for us, and Google Translate doesn't do the trick for Latin.\r\n\r\n## Sounds neat! Which text are you starting with?\r\nWe're starting GitClassics with an 1830 poem called [_Pugna Porcorum_](https://github.com/GitClassics/PugnaPorcorum) (\"The Battle of the Pigs\"). It's one of the strangest, most impressive Latin texts around.\r\n\r\n![Pugna Porcorum Frontispiece](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitClassics/gitclassics.github.io/master/frontispiece.jpg)\r\n\r\nIt's hundreds of lines long and written in dactylic hexameter, and every word begins with the letter 'p' (including words in the footnotes). It's an absurd but stunningly virtuosic piece of literature.\r\n\r\n![Sample of Pugna Porcorum Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitClassics/gitclassics.github.io/master/hexameters.jpg)\r\n\r\n## I don't know Latin! Can I still help?\r\nSure! You can help create plaintext editions of these texts simply by transcribing what you read in a scanned image into a plaintext file. No knowledge of Latin required.\r\n\r\n## Great, how to I start!\r\nClone the [PugnaPorcorum repository](https://github.com/GitClassics/PugnaPorcorum), transcribe some of the Latin from the PDF into one of the text files, and submit a pull request. Once we've finished transcribing the Latin, we can start working on an English translation. (Of course, people are welcome to work on translations into other languages, too!)\r\n\r\n## Who is in charge of GitClassics?\r\nMy name is Charles McNamara, and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Classics at Columbia. I hope GitClassics creates opportunities for hobbyists to work on neat projects that explore the long, fascinating history of Latin. I also hope GitClassics helps professional classicists collaborate on work that is often solitary and tedious.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
